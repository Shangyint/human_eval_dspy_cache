A string is called palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward. You should return a tuple containing the result string and True/False for the check. Example For s = \\\\\"abcde\\\\\", c = \\\\\"ae\\\\\", the result should be (\\'bcd\\',False) For s = \\\\\"abcdef\\\\\", c = \\\\\"b\\\\\" the result should be (\\'acdef\\',False) For s = \\\\\"abcdedcba\\\\\", c = \\\\\"ab\\\\\", the result should be (\\'cdedc\\',True) \\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to Code: def reverse_delete(s, c): result = \\\\\"\\\\\" for char in s: if char not in c: result += char return result, result == result[::-1]\\\\nCode:\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1716969574.7363682}
