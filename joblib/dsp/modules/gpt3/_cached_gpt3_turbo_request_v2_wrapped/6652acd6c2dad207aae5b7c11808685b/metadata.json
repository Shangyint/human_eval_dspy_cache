However, what people don\\'t know is Tribonacci sequence. Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence: tri(1) = 3 tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even. tri(n) = tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd. For example: tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2 tri(4) = 3 tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4) = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
